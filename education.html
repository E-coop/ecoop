		<strong>Persistence and retention </strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		Overall, using the system helped students remain successful in their classes by providing 
		an easy option to overcome challenging circumstances.This was particularly true for 
		sequenced classes, such as foreign languages.(EDUCAUSE,2018)
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Student empowerment</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		The system empowers students experiencing setbacks and other serious life challenges, 
		letting them demonstrate to their instructors, their classmates, and themselves that 
		they want to be in class and are committed to learning.(EDUCAUSE,2018)
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Comparable learning experiences</strong>
		<br>
		While other technologies might allow only one-way communication or asynchronous learning, 
		telepresence robotics facilitates active participation and peer interactions during class.

	  Easy implementation.
	  </strong>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  The system offers a flexible, affordable, and simple solution. 
	  Training students and instructors is a relatively quick process, while supporting documentation.(EDUCAUSE,2018)
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>
	  Minimal impact on instructors. 
	  </strong>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Although instructors require some training to integrate the system
	  into their classroom, its actual use is typically easier for instructors than extending deadlines, 
	  changing assignments, or scheduling alternate exam days.(EDUCAUSE,2018)
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>
	  Empowerment for student-support staff. 
	  </strong>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  In terms of the services we provide students on our campus, the pilot helped us identify and fill a gap: It let us provide immediate, short-term assistance for students who were experiencing temporary setbacks. 
	  The telepresence robot used in our study offered a viable solution that empowered our staff to help students who may have had no other options.(EDUCAUSE,2018)
