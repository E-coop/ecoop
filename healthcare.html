		Limited physician and clinician resources can now be scaled across multiple
locations to provide consistent, optimized levels of quality care. Specialized
diagnoses and face-to-face consultations can be delivered cost-effectively and
more frequently. Hospitals and specialty centers that are linked using Cisco
TelePresence can take advantage of scarce resources, such as ICU physician
monitoring, virtually.

		The system gives patients access to specialists across the world.Limited physician and clinician resources can now be scaled across multiple

		<br>
		<strong>Increase Collaboration</strong>
		<br>
		While other technologies might allow only one-way communication or asynchronous learning, 
		telepresence robotics facilitates active participation and peer interactions during class.enabling executives, physicians, specialists, patients, and suppliers to meet, discuss, and make
        decisions in real time, regardless of their locations, you can help them reduce the inefficiencies of
        traditional collaboration tools.The ability to provide remote care can
also be a recruiting and retention benefit for physicians. In addition to direct
caregivers, research teams and sales teams can benefit from enhanced
collaboration capabilities as they develop new drugs, provide training on new
instruments, or consult on innovative procedures.(cisco)

	  Lower Costs

	  <br>
	  Imagine wanting to bring your sick family member to the best specialist in the world, but your bank account 
	  would not allow you to? Many individuals incur expensive travel costs and waste money on the wrong medication.
	  Telepresence reduces the cost to the patient in time and travel and improves accessibility to, and the reach of,
	  specialists all over the world.educes the need for frequent travel,
enabling people to accomplish more in the same amount of time â€“ without the stress and fatigue
associated with travel.  Residents and staff
no longer have to travel extensively for training, improving their clinical productivity,
reducing travel-related fatigue, and minimizing travel expenses.
