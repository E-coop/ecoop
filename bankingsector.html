		<strong> Increases the effectiveness of the internal organization</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		One of the first banks to push this forth was, Bank of America.They use high quality video and sound for meetings between staff.It allows 
        banks to have meeting regardless of the location of their staff.Thus saving time. Telepresence does not only allow for videoconferencing,
		but it also allows for interactions.


With this technology, the bank made it possible for customers to interact with mortgage specialists, financial advisors and small business bankers from the comfort of their homes or offices. 
This technological advancement was put in place because the bank recognised the changing shape of the consumer banking landscape
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Gain expert opinion or diagnosis globally</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		The system gives patients access to specialists across the world.Limited physician and clinician resources can now be scaled across multiple
locations to provide consistent, optimized levels of quality care. Specialized
diagnoses and face-to-face consultations can be delivered cost-effectively and
more frequently. Hospitals and specialty centers that are linked using Cisco
TelePresence can take advantage of scarce resources, such as ICU physician
monitoring, virtually. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Improve Customer Service</strong>
		<br>
		Telepresence allows the bank to extend their services beyond the walls of their
		institution for their potential and current customers.
